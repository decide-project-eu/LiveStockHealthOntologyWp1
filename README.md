1: Create a standardized FAIR guideline framework that balances data requirements, accessibility, availability, connectivity, and value generation.

2: Design a Livestock Health Ontology (LHO) tailored to specific species, enriching knowledge graphs with domain expertise.

3: Convert raw cattle data into RDF format, harnessing RDF benefits for improved data sharing, integration, and querying.

4:Create a mapping process to match the cleaned RDF data with the species-specific LHO ontology, ensuring that the data can work together smoothly and be easily understood. You can find the code in R, PySpark, and Python notebooks here.

5: Implement a data visualization tool to analyze and report farm animal disease management data, empowering insightful decision-making and data interpretation.
